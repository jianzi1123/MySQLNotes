WHERE manager_id IN (
                        SELECT employee_id
                        FROM employees 
                        WHERE last_name = "De Haan"
                    );
#方式二
SELECT employee_id, last_name, hire_time, salary
FROM employees emp
WHERE EXISTS (
                    SELECT *
                    FROM employees mgr
    				WHERE emp.manager_id = mgr.employee_id
                    AND mgr.last_name = "De Haan"
                );
```

18.查询各部门中工资比本部门平均工资高的员工的员工号，姓名和工资(相关子查询) 

```mysql
SELECT last_name, salary, department_id
FROM employees e1
WHERE salary > (
				SELECT AVG(salary)
				FROM employees e2
				WHERE department_id = e1.department_id
				);
#子FROM中使用子查询
SELECT e.last_name, e.salary, e.department_id
FROM employees e,  (SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) avg_sal
					    FROM employees
                                            GROUP BY department_id) t_dept_avg_sal
 WHERE e.department_id = t_dept_avg_sal.department_id
 AND   e.salary > t_dept_avg_sal_avg_sal;         
```

19.查询每个部门下的部门人数大于5的部门名称（相关子查询）

```mysql
SELECT department_name
FROM departments d
WHERE 5 < (
                SELECT COUNT(*)
                FROM employees e
                WHERE d.department_id = e.department_id
            );
```

20.查询每个国家下的部门个数大于2的国家编号（相关子查询）

```mysql
SELECT country_id
FROM locations l
WHERE 2 < (
                SELECT COUNT(*)
                FROM department d
                WHERE l.department_id = d.department_id
            );
```

总结：

子查询的编写技巧：

- 如果子查询相对较简单，从外往里写；一旦子查询比较复杂，就从里往外写；

- 如果是相关子查询，通常从外往里写
