1、使用表employees创建视图

```mysql
create or replace view employee_vu (lname, emp_id, dept_id)
as
select last_name, employee_id, department_id
from employees;

desc employee_vu;

select * from employee_vu;

create or replace view employee_vu (lname, emp_id, dept_id)
as
select last_name, employee_id, department_id
from employees
where department_id = 80;
```

2、创建视图

```mysql
create or replace view emp_v1
as
select last_name, salary, email
from emps
where phone_number like '011%';

# 修改
create or replace view emp_v1
as
select last_name, email, phone_number, salary
from emps
where phone_number like '011%' 
and email like '%e%';

# 修改
select *
from emp_v1;

update emp_v1
set salary = salary + 100;

# 删除
delete from emp_v1
where last_name = 'Olsen';

# 创建
create or replace view emp_v2(dept_id, max_sal)
as
select departmen_id, max(salary)
from wmployees
group by department_id
having max(salary) > 12000

# 删除视图
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS emp_v2;

```
